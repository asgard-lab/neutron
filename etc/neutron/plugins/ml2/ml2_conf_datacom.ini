[ml2_datacom]

# Datacom global configurations.

# The configurations imputed here will be treated as the default to 
# the other Datacom Switches. Use this if most of then follow a pattern
# of configuration
#
# Format of the configuration:
# dm_username=<credential username>    (1)
# dm_password=<credential password>    (2)
# dm_method=<http or https>            (3)
#
# (1) The default username used to login and manage the Switches.
# (2) The default password used to login and manage the Switches.
# (3) The default method used to login and manage the Switches. This

# Datacom Switch configurations.
#
# Each Datacom Switch used must be imputed and configured here,
# otherwise Neutron won't be able to recognize the Switch.
#
# Format of the configuration:
# [<IP address of switch>]             (1)
# <hostname>=<port>       			   (2)
# dm_username=<credential username>    (3)
# dm_password=<credential password>    (4)
# dm_method=<http or https>            (5)
# dm_port=<communication port>         (6)
# dm_nports=<number of switch ports>   (7)
#
# (1) The IP of the Switch between brackets. The other configurations refer
#     to this Switch untill another Switch is found.
# (2) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Switch physical port (interface) it is connected to.
# (3) The username used to login and manage the Switch. If none is set

#     defaults are 8080 for http and 443 for https. 
# (7) Number of ports (interfaces) the Datacom Switch have.

# Example:
# [192.168.1.109]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=1/2
# dm_username=admin
# dm_password=admin
# dm_method=https
# dm_port=2443
# dm_nports=20
